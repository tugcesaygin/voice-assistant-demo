 <h1>Dorian Voice Assistant Demo</h1>
 <p> This is my Python AI project - Personal Voice Assistant Dorian! I use <em> Speech Recognition and Pyttsx3 libraries </em> to make the program work with voice command.
            There are a few interactive commands so you can even talk with him!!
            Dorian can connect Youtube and plays songs that you want , can tell you the date & do some searching for what you're looking for with Wikipedia!
            Also Dorian can make jokes!
